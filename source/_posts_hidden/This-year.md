Maybe I should write something today, but I don't would to write anything recently. I use a grammar tool named "Grammarly" to help me correct my grammar error this moment. As for why I started to write this in English because I found Simplified Chinese is limited for some reason. And I am difficult to write something about emotion directly. I am trying a new way, although I could just use simple sentences.

Changing the job is the most correct and biggest thing this year I did. No need to talk about it more.

I make a new friend this mouth when playing script-killing. She was once an overseas study in Korea. She will be my first friend if she is exactly to be my friend. I recalled It's full 3 years today from I come to Beijing. It's full 3 years I don't have any friends.
 
This is life, it keeps going on.
