    英语老师并不给口语不好的人机会。<img src="unhappy.png" />

    原本有 Unit 1 ~ Unit 6 一共六个单元的内容需要背。是的这里列出了两篇，默写的。

    时间隔了好久，从1.9的最后一篇四级作文到12.7的第一篇课文翻译。英语确实很难啊！

    四级作文记了两篇坚持不下去，就搁置了。当时两篇作文用了两个星期的时间。然后就到最近，老师要求被课文翻译，一共六个单元。反正快考四级了，英语怎么学都是学，就决定背一下，期末还会考课文，背了也不亏。两天时间背了两篇。课文翻译比四级作文要简单很多，句子大多是简单句，虽然也有生词，不过还不算是问题。

    问题是老师说只能背，不能背写。平时成绩的问题。

    这种要求真的可以完全把我难住。如果可以背写的话还能试一下，但是背，嗯，挂科无憾。

    所以就决定可以放心地旷课了，几乎没有故意旷课过，感谢英语课给了我旷课的勇气。<img src="neutral.png" />

    有的人英语本来就好，不用做任何准备裸考就能过。然而有的人T\_T。

    以我三个月断断续续的复习、做了很多篇模拟题以及很多份真题的经验来看，我敢很肯定的说，今年的四级考试，肯定过不了。。。

    难不成为了听好听力，就从小学的字母发音开始恶补基础吗，应该为了写好作文，就从小学的遣词造句开始学习语法吗。你努力，拼命在追赶的，是别人的起点。为什么非要走这条路？如果可以在其它路上超越别人，可以凭借其它技能找到工作，挣到钱，还有必要依靠这个吗？

    可是连这个都搞不定，不甘心啊。

(Unit 2) Realizing the great national rejuvenation, which we define as the Chinese Dream, has been the greatest Chinese expectation since modern times. It basically means achieving prosperity for the country, renewal of the nation and happiness for the people, thus ensuring that every enterprising Chinese carries, generation after generation, the firm conviction that a better life is accomplished through persistent effort. People should achieve their prosperity through diligence, courage, creativity and determination instead of aid from society or other people. Each individual is a participant and a designer in the casue of realizing the Chinese Dream, it is a dream not only for the entire nation, but also for every Chinese.

(Unit 1) Nowedays, many young people no longer choose “stable” jobs. Instead, they prefer to start their own businesses and realize their self-value through their own wisdom and efforts. Young entrepreneurship is the source of national economic vitality in the future. The success of entrepreneurs not only creates fortune, increases job opportunities, improves people’s life, but it is also good for the country in long term. Entrepreneurs are a driving force in upgrading China’s economy. Especially for the time being, our country is encouraging people to start their own businesses and make innovations and giving pocily support for medium and small businesses. This further arouses young people’s enthusiasm to start their own businesses.

Many cultural and sporting events are held on our campus each year, and I often participate actively in them. I find it beneficial to be involved in various campus activities. The speech contest held last month has benefited me most.

The speech contest was held by the Students Union. The moment I was informed I would compete with more than 100 competitors, I became exceedingly nervous. But my roommates encouraged me and cheered me on. They are all willing to be my audience whenever I wanted to practice speaking, giving me much courage. They also offered me constructive advice to help me imporve my presentaion skills. Thanks to their support, I ranked third in this speech contest. The speech contest not only gave me a opportunity to practice eloquence and strengthen my confidence, but also deepened the friendship between my roommates and me.

I will take part in such campus activities as a speech contest. I would contend they should be organized regularly to make our college life more colorful and meaningful.

If a foreign friend is coming to visit our campus, the most intersting place I'd like to take him/her to see is the school art gallery. There are many exhibitions held here periodically, including calligraphy, painting, photograpy and sculpture, etc. Most of exhibits are created by our university students, but somtimes, there are some authentic works of well-known artists, like the famous painting Shrimp by Qi Baishi.

The reason why I take him/her to the school art gallery is that I hope he/she can known more about the campus life of Chinese university students. I'd like him/her to known that our campus life is not defined to study; on the contrary, our campus life is rich and colorful. In addition, compared with other places, the school art gallery is more representative, because it collects excellent works of our university students and it shows our intelligence and wisdom intensively.

I'm glad that our school has this art galley and I believe that everyone comes to see it will like it.
