</head><body><div><div class="inner"><h1>This year (2022)</h1><div class="time">2022-12-30</div><div class="title-margin"></div><p>I posted the same title article last year, so I want to make this a traditional behavior, just like I write “The Brave” series every China’s National Day, that’s about the topic of dreams, and this is about the topic of life.</p>
<p>It’s an important point last year in the article that I made a new friend when a similar day as the recent day a year ago. My life is almost around her fully this year, although we are just friends. It’s difficult to say whether it is a lucky thing or unfortunate. It’s good because friends could be forever but other relationships may break quickly. And it’s bad because many things are limited by the relationships named friends.</p>
<p>I’m confused about this thing many times and argued many times with her. </p>
<p>Is there exist pure friendship relationship between the different gender? I think there is no… But we should objectively analyze this problem. I separate the problem into two sides. On the idea side, absolutely have not. You may think something even though you just watches a girl in street. But on the action side, it’s possible to have. It’s easy to understand because behavior is limited by morality. So this problem is cleared.</p>
<p>Actually, we are deeper than friendship already. So I am not too more disappointment about it.</p>
<p>And… I don’t know what to say now. Ooh, I remembered something she did for me. But… It has not necessary to write it down here.</p>
