的3个优点：goroutines、有类型的垃圾回收、简洁的标准库。除了 goroutines，其他两点对程序员甚至没有太大感知。不过视频里提到的 [go-is-not-good](https://github.com/ksimka/go-is-not-good) 倒是有点意思，详细列举了 golang 的种种缺点。\r\n\r\n感觉视频提到的点并不是很有说服力，就查了一下，原来视频的讲述者 Carmen Andoh 是 google 的员工，可以算是 golang 的布道者了。从 Carmen 的 github 账号 [Lyoness](https://github.com/Lyoness?tab=overview&from=2016-12-01&to=2016-12-31) 来看，她的代码能力似乎并不显著，而且在视频里的讲话过程中，她经常有一个捂嘴的小动作，不知道是不是对演讲的内容不够自信呢。\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smallyunet/hexo-blog/issues/comments/688016445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smallyunet/hexo-blog/issues/comments/689286223","html_url":"https://github.com/smallyunet/hexo-blog/issues/7#issuecomment-689286223","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smallyunet/hexo-blog/issues/7","id":689286223,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4OTI4NjIyMw==","user":{"login":"smallyunet","id":20765689,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzY1Njg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20765689?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet","html_url":"https://github.com/smallyunet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-09T03:59:09Z","updated_at":"2020-09-09T03:59:09Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"英文邮件大多数底部有一个

目前多人协同编辑的工具已经很常见，为什么没有人投入使用。\r\n2. Office 是否有强制限制样式格式的机制，保证样式在各版本、各平台的统一，想改样式都改不了的那种。如果有，为什么没人用？如果没有，为什么没有？\r\n3. 流程上的问题，应该在确保内容不会有更改之后，再严格修正样式。而不是调整好样式之后，让别人按照要求更改。\r\n\r\n这些都是提议，都是问题，目前并没有答案（以后会有的）。\r\n\r\n关于 Office 的样式格式，已知的是：\r\n1. Office 有模板功能，但只是模板，没有强制约束。即使只是模板，也似乎没人用。\r\n2. Office 提供了 API，可以按照指定格式生成文档。不过少量使用的话成本有点高。\r\n\r\n另外关于 Office 字体的问题，有点纳闷，在不同平台不同软件编辑过后字体配置就变了。\r\n\r\nHTML关于字体的逻辑是，字体由样式文件（CSS）决定，如果字体存在，就按照指定字体显示，如果字体不存在，就显示默认字体。字体是一种配置，仅取决于配置文件，和平台环境无关，这个配置无论用什么编辑都不会自动改变，除非有意识修改这个配置。\r\n\r\nOffice 的字体问题，是很无聊的问题。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smallyunet/hexo-blog/issues/comments/712535404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smallyunet/hexo-blog/issues/comments/713236063","html_url":"https://github.com/smallyunet/hexo-blog/issues/7#issuecomment-713236063","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smallyunet/hexo-blog/issues/7","id":713236063,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMzIzNjA2Mw==","user":{"login":"smallyunet","id":20765689,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzY1Njg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20765689?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet","html_url":"https://github.com/smallyunet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-21T01:36:19Z","updated_at":"2020-10-21T01:36:19Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"如果养一只猫，就养加菲猫，如果养一只狗，就养秋田犬。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smallyunet/hexo-blog/issues/comments/713236063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smallyunet/hexo-blog/issues/comments/720973404","html_url":"https://github.com/smallyunet/hexo-blog/issues/7#issuecomment-720973404","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/smallyunet/hexo-blog/issues/7","id":720973404,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMDk3MzQwNA==","user":{"login":"smallyunet","id":20765689,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzY1Njg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20765689?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet","html_url":"https://github.com/smallyunet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smallyunet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-03T08:26:55Z","updated_at":"2020-11-30T10:43:32Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"可用的
