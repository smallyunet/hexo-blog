And then… maybe did some things that I can’t consider as completely wrong.</p>
<p>I practiced English every day using the Duolingo app and have already kept it up for 150 days. It’s actually helpful for improving my English, but my English is still terrible now.</p>
<p>This year, I also learned some lessons about what real investing is. I paid a high price—like an expensive tuition fee—for these lessons and realized that it’s important not to make margin trades at any time.</p>
<p>This year wasn’t too bad overall. I went on a solo trip to several cities. Although I didn’t feel many happy moments, I still gained some fresh experiences. It taught me how to face a completely unfamiliar environment. I also realized that travel itself doesn’t bring happiness—true happiness should come from a stress-free life.</p>
<p>About relationships, it seems they are heading in a better direction, and I made many beautiful memories this year. I didn’t make any new friends and spent almost all my time on work or rest. By the way, I don’t need internet friends. Never.</p>
<p>About my career, although I did something significant in my last job, it didn’t have much impact, and it’s unlikely to have any effect on my future either. Still, I don’t regret it.</p>
<p>Next year will also be a challenging year. I just hope life can get better, even in a seemingly hopeless situation.</p>
